# Alarm Clock

## Description
This is a simple alarm clock that serves a web page to set the alarm time and sound. A RTC module and 7 segment display are used to display the current time and alarm time. When the alarm time is reached, the sound will play until turned off. 

A proximity sensor will be used to turn the alarm off. This way it will require physically getting out of bed and won't have to introduce any buttons.

An LED strip will be used to introduce ambiant lighting during the wake up cycle and make wakeing up less abrasive.
